Reverse Snake

> The Ultimate Survival Challenge

Reverse Snake takes the classic gameplay of the traditional Snake game and turns it on its head. Instead of controlling the snake, you control the food that the snake is trying to eat. In a twist of fate, your goal is to survive for 4 minutes on a spaceship--Ship AX6T--without getting consumed by the ever-growing snake.

The environment is set in a sci-fi world, where you, as the food, must navigate a ship full of narrow corridors and increasingly dangerous areas as the snake hunts you down. If you can manage to survive for 4 minutes, you win. But if the snake catches you? Well, you'll die trying.
